            <p>
                On your first visit you will fill out brief paperwork with the receptionist in the lobby. You can also 
                fill out the forms before you come and bring them with you to your appointment. <strong>Download the health history form 
                <a href="~/content/health_history_form.pdf" download>here</a> and 
                the body form <a href="~/content/Body_form.pdf" download>here</a></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                After checking in, you will be taken to an exam room in the back. Here Dr Pugsleyâ€™s Physician Assistant, 
                Brian Hess, will gather information about your current condition, past treatments, medical history, and 
                order any test needed to confirm treatment options. If tests are needed, most can be done in our office or 
                you may schedule them elsewhere. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After receiving test results, Dr Pugsley and Hess will explain specifics about your diagnoses and condition. 
                Together, you will discuss several treatment options. Cost, effectiveness, and longevity of treatments will 
                be considered and fully disclosed. This patient centered process helps you have full confidence in your care, 
                knowing it is the best fit for your needs and situation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Treatments are then scheduled and performed at our same location. Most procedures are relatively brief and 
                patients return home within a few hours. Depending on the chosen treatment plan, follow up, strengthening, 
                or adjustments will be made.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of it all, we are committed to you being satisfied with the care you received. Our top 
                priority is ensuring our patients are healthy and happy.
